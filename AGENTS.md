## Goal

claude boys, ralph boys, it's your time to shine and prove me wrong

create a new repo, copy just the two C files from here. they are about 14 days of work worth, they contain the full game decompiled and mapped out, with all the gameplay related functions correctly typed and renamed. you don't have to do the hard part in this assignment.

your task is to rewrite the game from scratch from these two files in any other language and engine of your choice and ideally make it run in a browser. share your result, ideally with a writeup of what you have learned and an open source repo.

this is a serious peace offering and im genuinely interested.

## Project Structure

- `decompile` contains the 2 aforementioned C files

Agent can determine everything else.
